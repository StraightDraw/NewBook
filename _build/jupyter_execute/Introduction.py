# JupyterBooks for Math Geeks

## Demo and Tutorial: Create your own math content using `jupyter-book`.

JupyterBooks makes publishing interactive web content incredibly easy, and all the powerful tools needed to make it work are open-source and free. Hands down, JupyterBooks is the best set of tools for displaying mathematics and science content whether you are sharing with a faculty team or creating materials for your students.

I made notes while learning to use [Python](https://www.python.org/), [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual), [GitHub](https://github.com/), [MYST](https://jupyterbook.org/content/myst.html) and the Jupyter tools: JupyterLabs, JupyterHub and [JupyterBooks](https://jupyterbook.org/). It's a lot to take in when you're brand new to it, but now I can create a new JupyterBook and get it deployed oneline in less than five minutes.

This template is a show-and-tell combined with a tutorial. In the right margin, I'll be making notes like this one about the special features of [MYST markdown](https://jupyterbook.org/content/content-blocks.html) that are creating the effects.

No warranty is implied or intended. I'm a self-taught noobie sharing advice for others who want to use these tools, especially my colleagues at the University of North Georgia.

MYST is an easy-to-learn markdown language that incorporates LaTeX, HTML and executable code blocks from an array of programming languages like MATLAB, R or Python. JupyterBooks adds the structure: logo, chapters, navigation structure, and previous-next buttons. MYST adds everything else: hyperlinks, images, equations and special code blocks.
