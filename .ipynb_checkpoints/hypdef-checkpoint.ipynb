    "\n",
    "Tables can be difficult to format in MyST when displaying complicated information. However, learning to use **cards** provides a solid workaround for many situations. The need for a Euclidean parallel postulate is demonstrated on one of my [College Geomtery course pages](https://straightdraw.github.io/Geometry/3EG/E0.html). The first column called **Neutral Geometry** shows what can proven *without* a parallelism axiom. The second column called **Euclidean Geometry** shows what additional theorems can proven *with* a parallelism axiom."
